# UX-UI (Kenzo)

In the brainstorming process, all stakeholders are taken in their entire human dimension because when they want to send us a message. We ask them to inform their civility and we provide them 3 choices : Mr, Mrs and other.
We do not know if stakeholders are informed about sustainable IT. But, we indicate on our website via a small green logo that we are a green website.
Moreover, to reduce energy resources and the impact of the material deterioration of the visual, we have implemented a visual soberness because we have used not a lot of colour, maybe less than 8 colours and these are not bright colours. We don’t use bright colours because it uses more energy than sober colours. 
To reduce our ecological footprint, there is a media management in place on our website. For example, we compress all our images to make it greener and faster. Moreover, we use a cache to store call results to our customers' database. This helps to reduce calls to the database that consume a lot of energy and time.
To conclude, we just have one specific font for the entire website which is ‘Poppins’ in two different weights. Moreover, we use the same page html for differents views. The views have little differences, so we don't duplicate code thanks to php.
